# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The magic ball 3D model currently displays a visible horizontal seam across the sphere surface along the X-axis (at Y=0). This seam is likely caused by UV mapping issues where the texture wraps around the sphere. While the model renders correctly in Blender without visible seams, the Three.js implementation shows this artifact. The goal is to eliminate this visual seam to achieve a seamless, professional appearance matching the Blender render quality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing the magic ball, I want to see a seamless sphere surface without visible texture seams, so that the visual experience is polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the magic ball model is rendered THEN the sphere surface SHALL display without any visible horizontal seams
2. WHEN the magic ball is viewed from any angle THEN the texture SHALL appear continuous and seamless
3. WHEN the magic ball rotates during shaking animation THEN no texture discontinuities SHALL be visible
4. WHEN the magic ball is illuminated by scene lighting THEN the surface SHALL reflect light uniformly without seam artifacts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the magic ball component, I want the texture seam fix to be implemented through material and rendering optimizations, so that the solution is maintainable and doesn't require model re-export.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the seam fix THEN the solution SHALL use Three.js material properties and texture settings
2. WHEN the fix is applied THEN the existing GLB model file SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN the component renders THEN the performance SHALL not be significantly degraded by the seam fix
4. WHEN the material is configured THEN the settings SHALL be well-documented for future maintenance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user experiencing the magic ball across different devices and browsers, I want the seamless appearance to be consistent, so that the quality is maintained regardless of the viewing platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the magic ball is viewed on different devices THEN the seam fix SHALL work consistently across platforms
2. WHEN different WebGL capabilities are available THEN the solution SHALL gracefully adapt to hardware limitations
3. WHEN the texture filtering is applied THEN it SHALL be optimized for the device's maximum anisotropy support
4. WHEN the material is rendered THEN it SHALL maintain visual quality across different screen resolutions
